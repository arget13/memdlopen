# memdlopen

This is an implementation of the technique developed in the paper [Remote Library Injection](http://web.archive.org/web/20060218185544/http://www.nologin.org/Downloads/Papers/remote-library-injection.pdf) published at Nologin. There's [another implementation](https://github.com/m1m1x/memdlopen) which has a severe problem: **code signatures**, which is precisely what I have fixed.
